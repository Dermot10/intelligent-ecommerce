Intelligent E-Commerce API

# Overview -

The Intelligent E-Commerce API is a robust backend service designed to power an e-commerce platform with future integration of machine learning components for personalized customer experiences.
Built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), the API provides functionality for managing users, carts, orders, and products.
With a scalable and modular architecture, the system is equipped to handle modern e-commerce challenges such as dynamic order processing, secure user authentication, and integration-ready endpoints for advanced analytics and recommendations.
